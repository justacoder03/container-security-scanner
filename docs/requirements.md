Product Requirements Document: Container Security Scanner
1. Overview
The Container Security Scanner enables users to scan container images in a repository, identify vulnerabilities in applications and dependencies, and prioritize remediation for critical and high-severity issues. It supports repositories with thousands of images.
2. User Needs

Vulnerability Identification: Identify container images with vulnerabilities and their severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
Prioritization: Highlight images with Critical or High vulnerabilities for immediate action.
Scalability: Handle thousands of images efficiently.
Actionable Insights: Provide detailed vulnerability information and remediation steps.

3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Dashboard

Display total images scanned, vulnerability counts by severity, and a list of images with Critical/High vulnerabilities.
Filters: Severity, image name, repository.
Sorting: By severity, image name, scan date.

3.2 Image Scanning

Integrate with container registries (e.g., DockerHub, AWS ECR).
Use vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD) for scanning.
Support scheduled and on-demand scans.

3.3 Vulnerability Details

Show per-image details: CVE ID, severity, affected components, remediation steps.
Export reports in CSV/JSON.

3.4 User Interface

Responsive web interface.
Search functionality for images/vulnerabilities.
Color-coded severity indicators (Red: Critical, Orange: High, etc.).

3.5 Notifications

Email/in-app alerts for new Critical/High vulnerabilities.
Configurable notification settings.

4. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: Scan 1,000 images in <10 minutes.
Scalability: Support up to 10,000 images.
Security: Authenticate users, encrypt registry credentials.
Compatibility: Support major container registries and Kubernetes.

5. Assumptions

Users have registry access and credentials.
Vulnerability database is available.

6. Constraints

Limited to accessible registries.
Dependent on vulnerability database accuracy.

7. Success Metrics

90% of users can prioritize Critical/High vulnerabilities within 5 minutes.
50% reduction in remediation time vs. manual processes.

8. Future Considerations

CI/CD pipeline integration.
Custom vulnerability policies.
ML-based vulnerability prediction.
